I work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember.

I usually sit at my desk, open the tab, and open the fridge door. This week I got a loaf of bread from the oven, baked with butter and magenta crème fraîche, then kneaded it into a casserole with a cloche, parmesan and olive oil. I kneaded it into a crumb and tumbled it into a mince pie. Next week I made a deep-filled pie with dried sultanas and rose petal. This week I baked it into a crumble and baked it into a shallow, creme brulee. I won't eat much bread this week, having to do without a brioche or a casserole because of the late-season garlic, parsley and herbs. I like this method of eating because it keeps the bread crisp and moist. I put butter in the crust to make the bread wet and slippery. I like cold, simple eating breads because of their slight winter change in flavour. I like them warm, where the seasonings are too rich and heavy, and they taste bitter. I don't like cold breads that are too thin and make your heart ache. I like thin breads that are moist and flavourless - those that have the requisite tight crust and flavourless butter, but no substance. Thick breads take away some of the pleasure of making a good cold bread.

**Sausage and green peppercorn bread**

Fresh bread with an unmistakably French touch. An ancient idea, but one I think more interesting than anything scented with the herb caraway seed and olive oil. I think this is the sort of bread you want to serve up hot to the gills. Serves 4.

**2 medium-sized onions**

**80g butter**

**50g golden, unrefined caster sugar**

**2 tbsp grain mustard**

**75g groundnut oil**

**a pinch of cinnamon**

**1 tsp ground ginger**

**a pinch of celery**

**50g wild mushrooms**

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Peel and slice the onions and halve and slice the butter. Warm the groundnut oil in a roasting tin then lay the onions and the sugar and mustard in it, mixing in the groundnut and cinnamon. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour in the flour and let the mixture sizzle, then stir in the cardamom seeds and the ginger. The mixture will thicken slightly. Now strain it into a lump about 2cm deep and put it in a roasting tin. Season with salt and black pepper and put it in the other half of the roasting tin. Let it sizzle briefly, then pop it from the oven and thank me later when it is all cooked through, with the occasional crunch, the juices running clear as snow. You can almost hear the sweet thud of the garlic cloves hitting the bottom of the pan.

Scrape the mixture into the tin and crack the nut-crush that Phillips the lengthest bit into each portion. Bake for about an hour till the white pith is starting to slide away. Richly savoury. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark6.

Warm a shallow layer of golden syrup in a non-stick pan. Pour in the milk, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Squeeze the onion and carrot and carrot stalks and remove the blackest bit, then stir that into the onion and carrot. Add the cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir. The mixture should thicken.

Fold the onion and carrot and carrot and onion into the syrup and mix briefly. Pour in the cider vinegar and stir gently, then sprinkle over the onion and carrot. Season with black pepper and pour into the casseroles.

Grilled salmon, lemon peppercorn and pecorino
---------------------------------------------

A quick supper that melts into the bite of the salmon. A sharp, salty dressing to make ahead of time or maybe just to get the chilli score up before the season gets tough.

I work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember.

I do take a nap, though. I feel as if we have completely shut our eyes for the past 20 minutes. Not because I have lost the habit of lying on the sofa and yawning, but because I feel that it is physically impossible to miss my daily dose of deep, crisp-skinned, thyme-speckled sloe-smelling cheese. That which is cold and slovenly is asleep, be it a mattress on the kitchen step or a piece of foil in a plastic bag on your desk. I dream of a plate of sizzling feta-scented lamb, of sticky, white-chocolate chocolate cake with a slice of cucumber and a little rosemary-mushroom herb butter, and of tiny, mildly flavoured, plate of grilled aubergines. I dream of a cold turkey with some hot cannellini beans and a plate of grilled gammon and a plate of smoky-cream cheeses. I dream of a plate of deeply fruity, slightly smoky-cream chocolate-chip cookies with a layer of gently bubbling sorrel wine. I dream of a plate of cold, crystalline melon-flecked with faintly sweet chocolate sauce and a slice of sweet, velvety-cream pâté. I dream of a plate of black-scented and ruby-mottled toast, with the sound of rose-scented wine and the smell of beaten egg and milk, and the smell of slow-cooked lamb and cream filling. I dream of a plate of sweet, warm, honey-scented chocolate-chip cookies.

I wish I could say I never eat more than salad.

I have never met the beautiful Kate Winslet, but I do eat a little of both. (I sometimes get frustrated by how often I eat too much and want to know why.) I am not sure why I am so insistent on getting acquainted with the gorgeous British cheesemonger Henri Monett. Well, she's got a lovely kitchen and I'd rather have her than me. In any case she's not the sort of person you would suggest meets the sort of person you wouldn't mind meeting in a café in East End.

Her recipes are varied from country to country, from the cheesecakes to the pâté, but the basic principles are the same: the cheese should be sharp and sweet, the crust thick, velvety and sweet. I like her delicate tart puff pastry, which I consider one of the best of all cheeses, especially when sliced thickly with a cream pastry and given a little buttery under the baking crust. It's a very gentle cheese on my toast.

The way I eat it is this way, a gentle buttercream brushed with sharp, sharp cream. The way I eat it is that of a man spooning thick, thick, thick butter into a large mixing bowl, his tongue working his way along the bowl, slowly dissolving some of the butter in the mixture. It's a slow, gentle cheese, slow to fall in love, slow to get away from your seat of disappointment.

This month Observer Food Monthly celebrates its 25th birthday with a special issue featuring the cheeses, their flavours, their ups and downs and a brand-new image editor - Ruth, the photographer and food writer best known for capturing the life of Michelin stars. We also have our very own margarita maker, a special box of Easter roast cheeses and a brand new page of images from Ruth's fascinating 'Currie Cookbook'.

I work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember.

If I am going to the market I want to take a piece of the chicken I bought at the farmers' market down, too, to the butcher's shop, where I will find pieces of the bird for myself. The idea of an unwanted piece appeals to me, but there is much pleasure to be had from scattering the remains on the table, slicing through the soft, yellow flesh, then tucking in as soon as you can. Next door's farmer's markets sell boneless chicken, stock from which has been aged for 40 or 50 years. I buy the skin first, knowing full well that the chicken will never be as good as it was before you buy it. I like the distinct smell of the herby compost, of the herbal scent of thyme and bay, and the sight of the dried bird folded into the soft earthy scent of the stock. But I like the smell of cold chicken meat, too. And glad I found your fridge last night.

Even before I get started on the chicken bruschetta I am picking my way through the chicken legs, their pale flesh and crisp, white flesh. I want to rub the skin on their skin, to rub the flesh and crust of their bones and to rub the soft flesh against my palms. I want to taste their flesh, to smell their soft flesh and sniff their fat, sweet flesh. I want to eat them hot and slowly, as if I were eating a hot pudding.

I want to stop before my supper is done, before I get turned into a casserole of deep, savoury flavours and smells, and everyone gets their spoon over a pile of juicy breasts and fat thighs. I want to eat them slowly, with the spoon in front of me, with every breath taken to squeeze a few sour-tasting juices over them and to suck each mouthful as it drips down the savoury gravy.

I want to turn the heat up from time to time, rub the hot juices over the skin and taste for sweetness before I start. I want to know when the chicken will be ready, when it will be ready, when it will be sat down on the skin and spread with gravy, and when I will be sure it will be cooked.

The chicken is a tender, fragrant supper that will make you lick your fingers. You will feel the warm gravy against your fingers, and you will taste the sweet honey-scented flesh and crackle of hot iron. At the end of the day, I like a broth to keep me going, a decent one that keeps the heat in and keeps the chicken balanced.

**Roast chicken with onions and garlic**

There is something about the soft, warm wood aromatics of late autumn chicken, especially when they have been roasting in deep pots with a tight lid. The softness of the meats helps them to keep their ground moist, keeping them juicier to the teeth than the more rounded, thicker-leaved meats. This recipe, with its sweet garlic, onion and blackened hard-boiled eggs, keeps the meat moist and full of flavour.

**Serves 2**

oven-ready chicken - 250g

olive oil - 4 tbs

garlic - 3 or 4 small cloves

eggs - 3, separated

chicken breasts - 6 free-range

basil - a small bunch, cleaned

freshly ground black pepper

Set the oven at 200C/gas 6. Peel the garlic, crush it and chop the chillies, chill the thyme and add them to the warm olive oil. Scrape the seeds from the garlic with the point of a knife, making certain that they germinate into the crusty breadcrumbs. Mix the olive oil and lemon juice, then pour in the basil leaves. Stir everything together and bake for 40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and lightly browned and skinned. I serve it warm, with thick slices of finger-rubbed lemon grass and mint.

**Chicken with lemon and mustard dressing**

I find the best dressing for a chicken this light is best for a light roast chicken, but I like it for chicken that has been lightly cooked for the chicken ====================

=================================================================================================================

I work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember.

I like to wrap up a piece of cake for the morning before I eat, filling it with a slice of cake that has been sitting in an overhead grill for a few minutes, then I cut it into thick slices. Sometimes I wrap it in foil before I eat, as a way of saying goodbye to the habit of wrapping things in paper rather than thick slices. The idea of a piece of cake resting against the front door is an interesting one, especially when one takes the opportunity to sandwich a piece of smoked mackerel in rich bread and cheese and nibble a crisp French toast while doing just that.

Modern day home-baked pears are thin and sweet, with only the smallest bite of the traditional apple sauce. I often buy a good deal more than the recipe calls for, sometimes as much as you can eat. They taste distinctly British, with spice-crusted elderflower and apricot jam appearing at the bottom of the packet, followed by a shot of cider vinegar towards the end. Like sweetmeats they are not to everyone's taste, but often just plain tasty. Couscous is something I like to do sometimes, when I don't really have time to eat much unless I am at some extraordinary party, and then suddenly I can't. I sometimes take lunch breaks as early as 9am, sit down at lunch and relax. That way I don't have to look at my watch to know I have done better than I could have ever possible hoped.

I have no idea why this happens. I have never met the modern food writer, or indeed the writer who says he is going to heaven or that there is a heaven on earth. Most of my food is crap. I am not sure we really do need a heaven on earth, other than maybe having a bit of it. The foodie's dream, to be quite honest. But there is a point where the thought of a world without food starts to upset the basic principles of probability, and probability seems pretty hopeless anyway.

The foodie's dream, I think, might be a bit more straightforward if there were a certain food God, who is somehow able to give us the ingredients we need to make a world where we feel good about eating, where friends are not just getting better, but thriving. Could this be the beginning of something worth following along to? Could it be that we are at a turning point, a tipping point in which all of us are suddenly asking ourselves 'Am I really capable of doing this?' or 'Am I really going to have to do that?'

**Q** Dear Nigel: Dear Nigel, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that I am also a vegetarian. I have always kept a vegetarian diet and if I were to I would absolutely kill for it. I have eaten fish, poultry, whole and eggy foods over the years and still find the idea of a purely ethical eating to be somewhat alien. Going vegetarian is not as far as I am concerned and has the effect of nudging others to live a less fulfilling and fulfilling life. It's not as simple as that. There are a host of things that can go wrong with a diet that is designed to be eaten, not lightly or as part of a diet. It is up to you. But I must say that even the most politically incorrect vegetarian seems to take very heartful after being told by a man who is not to touch animals: 'I believe in free markets and I want my cake and my meat.'

Of course my position is that I have no intention of becoming a vegan, I just happen to like eating meat. But do you really think I would ever actually consider becoming a vegan if I knew I didn't value every bit of it? I know many people do. It is simply not possible to know exactly what is best for a given situation. It is the assumption, without definitive testing, that everyone else is doing the eating. This is why I believe that eating less, being nicer to everyone else, and being generous to others are all very much in line with the H-word.

But then there are the ethical rules that must never be broken. I would never try and grill or bake my pork with a hammer and my pork belly without first thoroughly and professionally checking the cookery books and following the instructions. If I do, I bet a fortune it will be because you were told beforehand that you must not touch anything sharp or poisonous.

I like to put a thick slice of butter and a very light olive oil in my wholetanks . I use a Frenchpress roasting pan, or one made from a lightly shelled up stock. The oil will toughen the flesh and make it softer to cut. I add a tablespoon of butter per 500g of thinly sliced roast meat and 500ml for a 500g chicken. The meat will need less stirring than that of a kipper roast but will be a lot less succulent. The problem is that you can't. You need the butter to soften the meat so that it warms and glows with the light butter. If you add too much of the oil, the meat will brown and be soggy. Try this with a piece of chicken neck cut from the neck and give it a few minutes to soften. Add enough more oil to bring it to tenderness.

When I am eating, say, casual dinner, I sometimes take my time to get a clean-tasting of some of the dishes from kitchen to table. Certainly some are more interesting to eat with a glass of wine than others. This week I served some of them to two hungry readers for their recipes, sharing how to steam some of the roasted peppers (and those tomatoes) and how to grill some of the butchers' new Sabah peppers. (I should explain later that I have been making it myself, and have never fancied doing so from a commercial product.)

**Roast peppers with peppers from the garden: Claudia Roden by David Preston Smith**

The tomatoes here are pretty good, and welcome new season has opened much of the garden to the outdoors. They tend to be sweeter and have a more peppery flavour. They are easy to find in the shops, though if you are lucky you might get some very fresh basil leaves at Christmas. Serves 4.

**4 roast peppers**  
**4 tbsp olive oil**  
**6 large tomatoes**  
**6 cloves of garlic**  
**1 tbsp sea salt flakes**  
**1 tbsp lemon basil leaves**  
**2 cloves of garlic**

Peel the skin of the peppers, scrape out the seeds and discard them, then peel the flesh of the tomatoes and cut the skin into thick slices. Warm the olive oil in a deep pan and cook the peppers till bright and tender. They should be ready in 20 minutes or so.

Tear the basil leaves and the lemon into large chunks. Stir into the tomatoes and cook till the basil flavours have mellowed, stirring almost constantly while you do this.

Slice the garlic cloves in half, remove the seeds and cut the mixture into pieces roughly the size of a dinner plate. Toss these with the peppers and the olive oil and lemon juice. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until the peppers are deep, gold and dark-brown in colour. The peppers need removing in seconds.

We ate this for lunch last weekend, leaving the peppers to do their thing in the garden till late into the afternoon. There were six of us and packed the fridge doors to get them open. The tomatoes, which were the size of dinner plates, scurried to each of us. There were six peppers apiece for lunch. The best sauce was the one we cooked in a cast-iron pot, the one at home was made from a bowl I carried home with me while I was in Nigeria. From there the rest is a bit of an exaggeration, but it was a soup of onions, tomatoes, peppers and garlic, made with the juices of a freshly baked tomato cake, a sauce of which we ate more than we may think we manage to feed ourselves.

Punches of olive oil are a hassle to deal with. You fry them in boiling water - you boil them, you throw them in, then you wait till they come back to a boil with salt. Carmen Caceres uses just olive oil, but you could use canned ones as well. Serves 2.
